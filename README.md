# **Readrs**

 When I moved recently, I had to travel with about 7 boxes full of books. At various points, I have tried to catalogue all of my books in excel or google spreadsheets, but they're not always easy to use. I wanted to create an app that I would like to use, and that others could get use out of.

The purpose of this application is to provide a way for users to keep a catalogue of their books, and create "shelves" to categorize them.
